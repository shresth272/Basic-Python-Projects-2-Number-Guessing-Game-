# Basic-Python-Projects-2-Number-Guessing-Game-
"This is a simple command-line Number Guessing Game built using Python. The player is challenged to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the program provides hints to guide the player — either "Go Higher" or "Go Lower" — until the correct number is guessed."
